# ArUco Detection Guide

Welcome! This guide will help you get started with the ArUco marker detection. By the end, you'll understand how to set up, build, and run the detection system to track ArUco markers in real-time.

**Prerequisites:**
- ROS2 Jazzy installed on Ubuntu
- Basic terminal/command line familiarity
- Webcam connected to your computer

## 1. Understanding ROS2 Workspaces

### What is a ROS2 Workspace?

Think of a ROS2 workspace like a **project folder for your robot code**. Just like you might organize a coding project with folders for source code, tests, and documentation, a ROS2 workspace organizes your robot software.

**The basic structure:**
```
your_workspace/
â”œâ”€â”€ src/       # Your source code (this is where you work!)
â”œâ”€â”€ build/     # Compiled code (auto-generated, don't edit)
â”œâ”€â”€ install/   # Ready-to-run packages (auto-generated)
â””â”€â”€ log/       # Build logs (auto-generated)
```

**Important concept: "Sourcing"**

Before you can use ROS2 or your workspace, you need to "source" it. Sourcing is like telling your terminal: *"Hey, here's where the ROS2 tools and my code live!"*

You'll do this a lot:
```bash
source /opt/ros/jazzy/setup.bash       # Load ROS2 tools
source install/setup.bash              # Load your workspace
```

### Workspace vs Package

- **Workspace** = A folder containing multiple packages (your whole robot project)
- **Package** = A single reusable component (like `aruco_detection` for marker tracking)

**Analogy:** If your robot is a car, the workspace is the garage, and each package is a specific part (engine, wheels, GPS).

For this project, you'll have **one workspace** with **two packages**:
- `aruco_detection` - Main detection logic
- `aruco_detection_interfaces` - Custom message types

## 2. Setting Up Your Development Environment

### Install Python Dependencies

This project needs specific versions of OpenCV and NumPy to work with ROS2 Jazzy.

**Why specific versions matter:**
- **OpenCV 4.8.x** - Has the `ArucoDetector` API we use
- **NumPy < 2.0** - Required for ROS2's `cv_bridge` (converts between ROS and OpenCV images)

**Installation:**
```bash
pip install opencv-contrib-python==4.8.1.78 numpy==1.26.4 --break-system-packages
```

**Note on Virtual Environments:**

For simplicity, we'll install packages system-wide. This is the most straightforward approach and avoids potential confusion with sourcing order and workspace setup.

### Clone the Repository

```bash
# Navigate to where you want your workspace
cd ~

# Clone the team repository
git clone https://github.com/rice-robotics-club/auto-nav-f2025.git

# Navigate to the workspace
cd auto-nav-f2025
```

## 3. Building the ROS2 Workspace

### Understanding the Project Structure

```
auto-nav-f2025/
â””â”€â”€ aruco_detection/
    â”œâ”€â”€ aruco_detection/           # Main detection package
    â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ aruco_detection/       # Python source code
    â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ launch/                # Launch files
    â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ config/                # Configuration files
    â”‚   â””â”€â”€ setup.py               # Package metadata
    â””â”€â”€ aruco_detection_interfaces/ # Custom message definitions
```

### Building Step-by-Step

Open a terminal and navigate to your workspace root:

**Step 1: Source ROS2**
```bash
source /opt/ros/jazzy/setup.bash
```
*What this does:* Loads all the ROS2 tools (like `colcon`, `ros2 launch`, etc.) into your current terminal session.

**Step 2: Build the packages**
```bash
colcon build
```
*What this does:*
- Compiles your code
- Generates message types
- Creates the `build/`, `install/`, and `log/` directories
- Prepares everything to run

This will take 30-60 seconds the first time.

**Step 3: Source your workspace**
```bash
source install/setup.bash
```
*What this does:* Tells ROS2 to use the packages you just built. You need to do this in every new terminal!

**ðŸ’¡ Pro Tip:** Add these to your `~/.bashrc` to auto-source on terminal startup:
```bash
echo "source /opt/ros/jazzy/setup.bash" >> ~/.bashrc
echo "source ~/auto-nav-f2025/install/setup.bash" >> ~/.bashrc
```

### Troubleshooting Build Issues

**"Package 'aruco_detection' not found"**
- Did you run `colcon build` from the workspace root?
- Did you source the workspace with `source install/setup.bash`?

**"No module named 'cv2'"**
- Install OpenCV with the pip command from Step 2

**Build errors or want a fresh start?**
```bash
# Clean everything and rebuild
rm -rf build install log
colcon build
```

**Rebuild just one package (faster):**
```bash
colcon build --packages-select aruco_detection
```

## 4. Running ArUco Detection

### Generate Test Markers (First Time Setup)

Before you can detect markers, you need some markers to detect! Let's generate one:

```bash
ros2 run aruco_detection aruco_generate_marker --id 1 --size 200 --dictionary DICT_4X4_50
```

This creates a file called `marker_0001.png` in your current directory.

**What to do with it:**
- **Option 1:** Print it on paper
- **Option 2:** Display it on your phone or a second monitor
- **Option 3:** Open it in an image viewer

Make sure it's at least 2-3 inches on screen/paper for best detection.

### Launch the Complete System

**With RViz visualization (recommended for testing):**
```bash
source install/setup.bash  # If you haven't already in this terminal
ros2 launch aruco_detection aruco_detection.launch.py
```

**Without RViz (for headless robot deployment):**
```bash
ros2 launch aruco_detection aruco_detection.launch.py use_rviz:=false
```

### What You Should See

When the system launches successfully, you'll see:

**1. OpenCV Window - "Detected Markers"**
- Live webcam feed
- When you hold up your marker:
  - Green outline around the detected marker
  - Red, green, and blue axes overlaid on the marker (showing its 3D orientation)

**2. RViz Window (if enabled)**
- A 3D view with a grid
- When you hold up your marker:
  - Small colored axes appear in the 3D space (red=X, green=Y, blue=Z)
  - These show where the marker is relative to the camera

**How to use RViz:**
- **Scroll wheel:** Zoom in/out
- **Middle-click + drag:** Pan around the scene
- **Left-click + drag:** Rotate your viewpoint

**3. Terminal Output**
You should see logs like:
```
[INFO] [aruco_node]: Marker size: 0.1
[INFO] [aruco_node]: Marker type: DICT_4X4_50
[INFO] [webcam_publisher]: Webcam publisher started
```

## 5. Understanding ROS2 Topics (The Communication System)

### What are Topics?

ROS2 uses **topics** for communication between different parts of your robot software. Think of topics like **radio stations**:
- Some nodes **broadcast** (publish) data on a topic
- Other nodes **tune in** (subscribe) to receive that data
- Many nodes can publish or subscribe to the same topic

### Key Topics in This System

**What `aruco_node` publishes (sends out):**

| Topic | Type | Description |
|-------|------|-------------|
| `/aruco_poses` | `geometry_msgs/PoseArray` | 3D positions and orientations for RViz visualization |
| `/aruco_markers` | `aruco_detection_interfaces/ArucoMarkers` | Marker IDs paired with their poses (most useful!) |
| `/aruco_detection/image` | `sensor_msgs/Image` | Camera feed with markers and axes drawn on it |

**What `aruco_node` subscribes to (listens for):**

| Topic | Type | Description |
|-------|------|-------------|
| `/image_raw` | `sensor_msgs/Image` | Raw webcam images from camera |
| `/camera_info` | `sensor_msgs/CameraInfo` | Camera calibration data |

### Useful Debug Commands

While the system is running, open a new terminal and try these:

```bash
# Don't forget to source first!
source /opt/ros/jazzy/setup.bash
source install/setup.bash

# See all active topics
ros2 topic list

# View real-time marker detections (hold marker to camera)
ros2 topic echo /aruco_markers

# Check how fast topics are publishing (should be ~30 Hz)
ros2 topic hz /aruco_poses

# Get detailed info about a topic
ros2 topic info /aruco_markers

# See what nodes are currently running
ros2 node list

# Get info about the aruco_node
ros2 node info /aruco_node
```

---

## 6. Quick Reference & Troubleshooting

### Daily Workflow

Every time you want to run the system:

```bash
# 1. Open terminal, navigate to workspace
cd ~/auto-nav-f2025

# 2. Source ROS2 and workspace (REQUIRED in every new terminal!)
source /opt/ros/jazzy/setup.bash
source install/setup.bash

# 3. Launch the system
ros2 launch aruco_detection aruco_detection.launch.py
```

### Common Issues & Solutions

| Problem | Solution |
|---------|----------|
| **"Package 'aruco_detection' not found"** | Did you source the workspace? Run `source install/setup.bash` |
| **"No module named 'cv2'"** | Install OpenCV: `pip install opencv-contrib-python==4.8.1.78 --break-system-packages` |
| **"No module named 'numpy'"** | Install NumPy: `pip install numpy==1.26.4 --break-system-packages` |
| **Markers not detected** | â€¢ Ensure good lighting<br>â€¢ Hold marker steady<br>â€¢ Make sure marker is large enough (2-3 inches)<br>â€¢ Check marker dictionary matches (DICT_4X4_50) |
| **RViz shows gray screen** | â€¢ Check topics are publishing: `ros2 topic list`<br>â€¢ Verify Fixed Frame is set to `map` in RViz |
| **OpenCV window doesn't show** | Normal on headless systems, use RViz instead |
| **Build errors after pulling new code** | Clean rebuild: `rm -rf build install log && colcon build` |

### Keyboard Shortcuts

- **Ctrl+C** - Stop the running system (in the terminal where you launched)
- **Q** - Close OpenCV window (when focused on it)
